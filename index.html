        <p><strong>
         Jessica Holmes was the first western woman to start an event company in Thailand. </strong></p>
         
         <p> Before going on to become a premier destination wedding planner in Asia, Jessie gained an impressive background working in music, events, media & marketing from a young age in Darwin, N.T.  
         </p>  
         
         <p>
          Jessie has created hundreds of seamless events that generate revenue and over the top feedback from the clients from all over the world. 
        </p>        
      

        <p>
        Now back in the land of Oz, Jessie is following her dreams once again and going back to her roots in music. She is managing up and coming artists and working on some big event ideas involving all her favourite acts and music from her punk teenage years to the ageing hippy tastes she acquired soon after. 
        
        <p>Her new business, <a href="https://bannedmanagement.com"> Banned Management </a> is set to include a conglomerate group of Tafe Music Business / Notting Hill Music Academy & QLD Conservatory of Music graduates, Jessie's mentors, music health advocate and sponsors.</p>      
        
      <p>Jessie's plans to revive Oz rock using artists, events, education & therapy programs designed to take us back to a time when rock was rebellious, fun ... and music could change the world. 
        </p>

      <p> 
While Jessie is waiting on government grants and support for the events she also has planned for the disabled, LGBQ, indigenous artists, aged and cancer care communities, she also available to work on all event or music requests, big or small. 
        </p>

      <p> Have a gig or band you want expertly managed ? A wedding that looks sensational? (Jessie has noticed these are few and far between in Australia and wants to change this too !). 
        
        <p>To build her network again in Australia, Jessie is even currently offering rates much cheaper than her usual fees in Thailand (which were astronomical ; ) and if your event is a concert or festival involving any one of all the great Aussie artists she listened to on repeat while living in Thailand, she might even do it free!   Get in now while you can by contacting her at <a href="hi@jessieholmes.com"></a> 
        </p>
        
        
      <p>
    Just need a bio full of shameless self-promotion ?   Talk to Jess.     She's a lot of fun too. 
    </p>      
      <p>Jessica Holmes is now living back in Australia on the Sunshine Coast and while she isn’t coming up with new ideas for music and events business, she's studying it, in a Diploma of Music Industry (Business) with the Notting Hill Music Academy and Tafe, being taught by artists and managers who have worked with all the greats including everyone from David Bowie, Kiss & Queen to Queens of the Stone Age.

        Here, I employed full time staff, a range of exciting vendors, stocked warehouses of professional event rental equipment and we produced up to 4 full-scale weddings & events per week at some of the most prestigious locations across Southeast Asia, including my own beachfront wedding venue at Maenam, voted 8th best beach in Asia.

    As the first western woman to start a wedding business in Thailand, my services were in high demand from the start by English speaking brides who had their hearts set on a destination wedding in Thailand as well as a wedding planner who understood them.   </strong>

          <p>  
            I have successfully pulled off hundreds of events that exceeded my clients’ expectations, from a country known for its language and cultural barriers. 
          </p>
      
          <p>
          I had to teach local venues and vendors about western wedding customs, deal with shady business practises and still manage to exceed the (often unrealistic) expectations of demanding clients all with different religions and backgrounds from all over the world. 
          </p>  
        


               
        <p>
          To do all this, I had to learn to do business like the locals and be as charming as possible in all my negotiations (while also staying alert to the possibility of being scammed). 

        <p>
          As a smooth talker from way back, being charming came naturally to me, although feeling suspicious did not. So, in an effort to feel more confident doing business in Thailand, I learnt the language and I also gained myself a reputation and bit of a nickname amongst the locals as ‘Baag Waan’, (meaning 'Sweet Mouth'). This, along with my sense of humour, was what enabled me to get most of what I wanted done in Thailand with a minimum of fuss.

        <p>
          On a side note, Thai is a tonal language and "mai mai mai mai mai mai" pronounced using different tones in Thai, translates to "New wood doesn’t burn quickly, does it ?". There are also 12 different types of smiles in Thailand, not all of them good. In fact, they even have one reserved just for car accidents.
        </p>  
       
        <p> 
          While my western counterparts were struggled to understand what was going on behind the scenes and many foreign run businesses were failing, my company has grossed over 1 million dollars in sales and achieved average yearly profit increases of over 40% from its first year of operation. 
        </p>
      <p>
        Because of all this invaluable experience, now that I am back home in Australia, I am extremely confident of being able to effortlessly slip into any role the events industry has to offer here.

            One of the best things about working in Thailand was the excitement I got from being able to organize crazy shows and performances, pyrotechnics, musicians, exotic animals and amazing set ups and lighting installations that were wrought with danger. 
          </p>
            
          <p> Due to the lack of any Work Health and Safety standards (apart from a sign out the front of construction sites erected with bamboo scaffolds that says "Safety First"), I was 'lucky' enough able to fulfil all kinds of crazy event briefs in a country that allows you to do anything you like and I was still lucky enough come out relatively unscathed. This is a testament to my trouble shooting skills. 

            <p> I have had to cajole hungry elephants and monkey ring bearers who would eat all the flowers on the aisle, steal the bride’s champagne and then pee all over the stage, leaving the guests in fits of laughter.</p> 

            
            <p>I have  also had to deal with countless scam artists, drunks, thieves, scary lady boys and ruthless venue owners who changed their conditions more than their underwear.

      Because of my passion for music and big events, it was always the receptions of couples who wanted huge concerts and shows with large scale sound and lights that were my favourite to organize. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Samui was something of a haven for a lot of shady characters with questionable backgrounds but living here meant I also had access to world class western musicians and international DJ’s (many of whom were bigger divas than the brides themselves). 
    </p>    
    <p> 
      I also had the pleasure of working with a range of a range of talented Thai musicians and performers, including expert musicians, dancers, acrobats, sculptures, transport, fire and magic shows, excellent sound and light technicians, adorable animals and their wild trainers.  
    </p>
    <p> 
      Aside from all the amazing entertainment and decor I’ve worked with, one of the most interesting parts of my role was working with the unique ceremony and reception requests of different nationalities from all over the world. As a result, my knowledge in all types of Western, Thai, Catholic, Christian, Buddhist, Indian, Chinese, Muslim and Jewish celebrations and traditions is expert.     
          </p> 

    <p>
      I think that being able to accomplish all that I have in my events business in Thailand shows why I am quietly confident of success back home working in the heavily regulated music and events industry of Australia with qualified, English-speaking staff at my disposal. 
    <p>
      Coming from Thailand and also in Darwin back in the day when lawlessness was the norm, I have been able to get away with a lot of things I probably shouldn’t have in terms of events and marketing (a lot of my experience in working with government comes from my job at the Conventions Bureau of the Tourism Commission who came up with the slogan C.U in the N.T). 
    </p>

    <p> Requesting approval from the average pen pushing council worker on my usual crazy event plans might be a little bit harder in Australia these days and so I am glad to have now studied all the rules and regulations in WHS and event laws in my Music Business studies through Tafe.   
    
      <p> 
        Armed with all this knowledge, I am eager to bring all the event ideas I can to the stage in Australia.

          Although I miss working with the crazy locals and even crazier expats of Thailand, not to mention my clients with lifestyles of the rich and famous asking for everything from tee-pees on the lawns of their $10,000 per night villas to Jet Ski arrivals with 'Eye of the Tiger' blasting from the beach, plus my own experiences being able to do things like stay in all the villas for free and arrive to secluded islands by speedboat and deliver entire weddings, I don’t miss some of the famous clients who expected free weddings for publicity or working in the hot sun on the beach from the early hours one morning until the next.  </p>


          <p>
          Being a wedding planner in Thailand was exhausting but it was gratifying being able to pull off all that I did behind the scenes without the customers knowing what a nightmare their wedding might have been without my help. But now that I’m focused on re-establishing a career for myself in music and events back in Australia though, I have no qualms telling my stories!
