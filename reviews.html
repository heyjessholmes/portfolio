                        From my first contact with Jessica 9 months before our wedding, I felt her warmth, enthusiasm and genuine care towards us and for our wedding. I emailed Jessica many many emails, weekly, and sometimes daily - she answered every single email and question with detail and thoroughness. Her responses were ordered and organised. I felt she was dedicated in helping us create our dream wedding and that she was extremely hardworking throughout the entire process. 
                      </p>
                      <p>3 days before my wedding, I was completely sressed out as my luggage had not arrived from Australia. Jessica provided comfort and encouragement. I felt comforted in knowing that I didnt have to worry about the organisation or set up of our wedding, as Jessica had that all under control, and that I could concentrate on trying to retrieve my luggage and keep myself together in preparation for my wedding!
                      </p> 
                      <p> On our wedding day, Jessica was like a security blanket for me - she said all the right things, she congratulated me, kept me calm and didnt stress me out with any small details or changes - she was fantastic. I felt so relaxed about the setup and wedding activities because I knew she was organising everything and that she had all the processes underway. All I had to do was enjoy the day! And I did! Our entire wedding was evidence of Jessica's organisation, planning and professionalism. Both ceremony and reception looked amazing, all the activities went smoothly, catering was amazing and the music added to the celebrations. Our family and friends, Eamon and I enjoyed the entire night - it was perfect.
                        <p> 
                          <p> Eamon and I have no hesitation in recommending Jessica Holmes of Koh Samui Island Weddings to any couple considering a wedding in Koh Samui. When planning an overseas wedding, it is hard to imagine what options are available and what the best choices are. Jessica was fantastic as she explained everything with detail and provided honest advice about all options. Being miles away, our dream Samui wedding would have been impossible without her services. 
                      </p>  
                      <p> Jessica is one the kindest people I know. She made our wedding dreams come true and we will never forget the part she played in our marriage. 
                      </p>   <p>  
                        Thankyou so much Jessica, for using your amazing talent to organise our entire wedding for us! We are so appreciative!
                      </p>  
                      <p> 
                        We look forward to catching up with Jessica some day again in Samui or maybe in Tasmania!

                        We were really impressed with everything that you organised for us Jess and couldn't fault our wedding day in anyway. So, here is our testimonial in which we mean every word.  
                        Scott and I were so impressed with Jessica's efforts and hard work. The team were amazing and we both want to thank you for creating the most amazing day. We dreamed of an intimate and private wedding and that is exactly what we got. We will treasure our Koh Samui wedding day memories forever.     </p>               
                        <p> Jessica, her team and everyone one else involved were so kind to us which was reassuring particularly for me as none of my family were present for support. Jessica is a really lovely person, she is so easy to talk to and patient. She made us feel relaxed and at ease on the run up to and on the day of the wedding. 
                        Jessica made our dreams come true, thank you for everything. It was the most amazing day of our lives.

                        Dear Jess & the Thai the Knot Crew, 
                        Jess & her team, where do I start?  What an absolute pleasure it was to have you as our wedding planner.  A year and half of correspondence via email seemed so daunting at first, but Jess’s attention to detail and prompt response time assured me that I had found the best wedding planner in Koh Samui. </p>
                        <p>Our wedding day was one of the most amazing days of our life and everyone who attended just raved about everything, from the flowers, the colour scheme, the ceremony set up, the table settings, the lighting, the food, the music, the fireworks, the lanterns and of course our favourite the elephant!  Jess’s choice of suppliers are second to none, we were thrilled to bits...
                        </p>
                        <p>.. Last but definitely not least, Jess, our wedding planner.  Jess took all the stress out of planning a wedding. From our many emails, our first meeting and the wedding day itself, her attention to detail was something I was very impressed with!  Every minor detail was always covered.    She also came up with suggestions with things I was having trouble with like choosing flowers, which were absolutely stunning, one of the stand outs of our wedding, the flowers, just perfect, we wanted to take them home with us. </p>
                        <p>
                        She is kind, caring and an extremely hard worker.  She runs around on your wedding day making sure everything is going to plan.   One of the best decisions we have ever made was choosing Jess to oversee our wedding. Once the wedding was over and all the guests had left, we sat by the bar and had a nice chat and a drink with Jess reminiscing on our magical day, she really makes you feel like you have known her for years.   A perfect stress free day, all thanks to the perfect wedding planner Jessica Holmes. </p>
                        <p>Thank you so much for all of your planning & excellent communication & attention to detail. You have made it a wonderful experience. 
                      Jess you are the best 
                        (Love heart) xxx  </p>

                        Right from the beginning Jessica was both enthusiastic and professional considering Camilla was in UK and Jessica was in both Australia and Koh Samui. Nothing was a problem to organize and even last minute requests were handled smoothly and efficiently. Although Jessica had lots of ideas and plans our own suggestions  were taken on board and the wedding day exceeded our very high expectations. Jessica and her staff were present at the wedding to assure that everything went without a hitch.

                        Fantastic!!!  A few friendly emails, with absolutely no stress and all was sorted. I was actually getting stressed because it was so easy and I assumed that something was going to go wrong. We were involved with 3 people - Jess the wedding planner, Roy the legal dude and Johnny the celebrant. This could not be any easier. Arrived in Bangkok and Roy took over, he gave all the exact details regarding what info we needed before arrival and that was it, half day and all done. Got to Samui and met with Johnny - real nice guy, got that sorted. </p>
                        <p> Then there was Jess, what an absolute Gem..... Everything was just so easy, nothing was too much to ask and all was to perfection. The day ran like clockwork and everyone had a fantastic time!! This was all due to Jess and her amazing team oh and of course her experience!! Jess you made our dreams come true and all I can say is a big big thankyou and we love you xxxxx"

                        Thank you so much for EVERYTHING!!  The night was an absolute triumph and you should feel proud of it - it was your baby as much as ours. 
                        Jessica Holmes: We worked with Jessica for nearly two years creating our perfect wedding day.  We were guided by Jess from everything from the time of year to the flowers, DJ and photographer.  The whole process was made so easy and Jess took the time to get to know us so she could get the feel for what we would like.  This was especially important when choosing the important parts of the wedding such as the celebrant and DJ, where prior meetings/viewings are impossible.  
                        
                        <p>She took the time to hear out our crazy ideas and did everything possible to make them reality.  Jess even went the extra mile for us as the week of our wedding she broke her foot, but, still co-ordinated the wedding from crutches.  She was genuinely concerned about our happiness throughout the planning and made sure everything went perfectly on the day.  We have nothing but happy and fond memories of the whole event and would recommend Jessica Holmes and Thai the Knot to anyone thinking about having their dream day on Koh Samui.    </p>
                        <p> Jess, 
                        Today is our one year anniversary and we still can't thank you enough for all the work you put in to our big day. Everybody had a wonderful time and it really doesn't feel like a year ago. Hope all is well in Koh Samui - wish we were back there. 
                        Thank you once again from the bottom of our heart<i class="bx bxs-quote-alt-right quote-icon-right"></i>

                        Jessica from Thai The Knot was our wedding planner for our big Indian wedding with 100 guests at Nora Buri Resort in Koh Samui. We had a total of 6 functions over 3 days in August 2016. 
                        We initially engaged Jessica while we were shortlisting venues for our wedding as we did not have much experience in Koh Samui. She gave us a lot of options to view and arranged for meetings with hotels, caterers, makeup artist and the priest during our preliminary visit. She and her colleague Nat were very helpful in this process. Despite having lesser experience with big Indian weddings, Jessica did not let that deter her. She did research and always keenly asked about all the rituals so that she could give us the type of wedding we dreamt of. We were very impressed with her work, hence we decided to engage her as our wedding planner for all our functions. </p>
                        <p>She planned a welcome dinner at the Manora Restaurant, a separate pool party at Ark Bar, a haldi and prayer ceremony in the Manora Conference Room, a beach party at the barge restaurant, elaborate groom’s procession and traditional Hindu wedding at the beachfront lawn & a reception in the Conference Room. </p>
                        <p>  As my husband was in Sydney and I was in Singapore, our communication with Jessica was mostly through emails and Skype calls. She was always prompt in her replies and kept us in the loop of all that was going on frequently. She managed the communications between us and all the other parties involved very well. 
                        She went through a great deal of effort to procure everything we asked for, big or small and even accepted our last minute changes etc. Without her help we would not have been able to manage all the liaisons between the various vendors. </p>
                        <p> Jessica, her colleagues and her staff, together with the hotel worked very hard to put everything together and make our wedding spectacular. She was very dedicated and sincere about ensuring that everything was perfect for our special days. </p>
                        <p>The countless hours she put in for the cost was extremely justified and I wouldn’t have chosen any other wedding planner. At Thai the knot, they make your event their event and are just as invested in ensuring it is perfect as you would be. We truly are very grateful to Jessica for putting together our big fat Indian wedding for us so amazingly.

                        To the happy almost couple!
                    We want to recommend to you without reserve the services of Jessica Holmes and the team at Koh Samui Island Weddings. Barb and I had our whole Thai wedding from end to end organised by Jessica – from the legal arrangements in Bangkok, to the choice of venue and accommodation, and the day itself from the morning preparations to the release of fire balloons into the night sky. Jessica has an eye for competent people, and has built a delivery team that delivered and delighted at every stage – the photographers, the makeup and hair stylists and of course her team. WE are no experts in Thai musicians or dancers, but to our eyes and ears the performance was great. 
                    
                    <p>What we are experts in is western instrumental music, and lo and behold, Jessica could even conjure up an acoustic guitarist as an impressive accompanist for Barb. We have not ceased to comment to friends on how effortless and gentle the day was. </p>
                    <p>  Finally, it was significant to us that Jessica also recommended what NOT to do. There is a legitimate fear that some service providers will "upsell" at the expense of your pocket, and of the experience. This is a particular risk you face in an overseas arrangement with an unknown person. Jessica was interested in the design of our day as an experience that held together and "worked" and suggested we didn't have some events we had considered. That was very reassuring to me as I emailed away at our arrangements. 
                   Our confidence was not misplaced.
                   We wish you joy with your Koh Samui Island Wedding.

                        Jessica transformed our idea of the perfect wedding into the completely perfect day. 
                        The beach ceremony was decorated beautifully, it was absolutely stunning. From the venue to the set-up and the beach and flowers, Jessica had captured everything we wanted. It was completely stress free, so much fun, very romantic and was the perfect balance between formal and casual. It couldn't have been anything more. Jessica clearly has a great range of suppliers and a fantastic knowledge of Koh Samui and wedding planning. She genuinely wants your wedding to be nothing less than your vision of perfect so we would definitely recommend a wedding in Koh Samui and Jessica to be your wedding planner.   </p>

                        I am incredibly happy with our decision to use Koh Samui Island Weddings to plan and organise our special day. Right from get go our emails where answered promptly and any questions we had were answered with no hesitation. Everything that we needed to make our day special was made available to us through the website. Nat and Bun, the two wedding coordinators that we there on the day were polite and happy to help in any way that they could. They were highly organised and willing to offer and take suggestions consistently. All of the staff were overly cooperative and both myself and my husband really had to put in little or no effort. EVERYTHING was organised right from the ceremony through the reception.

                     Still to this day it feels like a proper fairy-tale wedding and so surreal. The photos and video montage are unbelievable and everyone who has seen it has cried. Even blokes. I amaze at the perfect coordination of the event...  In the end, it was an incredible romantic moment in my life which I won’t ever forget and I can whole-heartedly recommend her services to you as I do to anyone who will basically listen. Thank-you Jess, you’re the best!" </p>
                    <p>It was absolutely perfect! Jessica gave us the most special day of our lives. My wife and I rave about Koh Samui Island Weddings and show off our gorgeous wedding video to our friends every chance we get.  <i class="bx bxs-quote-alt-right quote-icon-right"></i>

                   <p> I don’t think I’m going to be able to convey to you how thrilled we were with our big day……but I’ll try. 
                    Firstly, Nat and Bun were sensational! Their attention to detail and level of care was beautiful and they ensured everything was perfect. The way they conducted themselves at the Temple was so moving and really added to the beautiful moment it was. My guests were blown away by the touching ceremony and have been inspired to do celebrate their 40th anniversary in 3 years’ time in a very similar way. </p>
                    <p> You can be very proud of your team. The day ran like clockwork and they were there at every turn, checking and double checking, always there but in a very subtle way, thinking ahead and quietly going about their business. We are truly delighted with ‘Thai the Knot’ from go to woe. We could not have asked for a more beautiful day. 
                    The temple was so special. We’d gone through the ropes with Nat and Bun on the Monday and had remembered most things, but they were there like little Angels guiding us through each step on the day so we didn’t feel  overwhelmed or lost….it was awesome….not a dry eye in the house J 
                    Then the lawn ceremony. Well, Stewart was fantastic. The guests had drinks with him afterwards and loved him and he was funny and poignant and everything you could possibly want. After we met with him on Monday, he incorporated in the ceremony a few things he’d picked up on and during that chat and absolutely nailed it. Having the Saree staff stand in a line and watch the ceremony made it so lovely, and they were really cute sitting in a little group at the Temple too.  Everyone at the pool gathered around and watched the ceremony and so, the next day we shared our cake with them, which they loved! </p>
                    <p> Which brings me to the food and celebration……fantastic!!! The way the table was set up and the food presentation and everything was perfect. We were so lucky with the weather. We got rid of the rain early and then the sun just did its thing for us for the rest of the day. J The night after our doo, it poured down right when we would have just started enjoying the food so, we were really blessed.
                    Our guests could not believe the feast and service and surroundings….it was truly a fairy tale. 
                    The photographer was wonderful too, very sweet and thorough and we LOVE our photos and album. It’s not easy making 49 year olds look good (J), but we have many photos we really love. It was so hot, but glasses of cold water just appeared and the parasols you guys organised for us, etc…..we all got through  it and it was such a joy. The Saree staff were incredible! All week, but especially on the Wednesday, they were there with so many lovely surprises and attentive helpfulness…..seriously Jess, I could go on forever. 
                    I would not only have no hesitation in recommending everything we’ve just had to anyone, but I would strongly suggest people go to Thailand to marry if they truly want the experience of a lifetime. 
                    So, thank you, thank you, thank you all!!!!!!! </p>
                    <p> We will certainly keep in touch and I know Greg and Jules will be in touch to organise their big day when the time comes. I will definitely convey the above on all and any testimonial sites you have when I get a sec. Would a message behind a Cessna be too much?? Ha-ha </p>
                    Jess, please give your team a huge hug and thank you from us and let them know if there is ever anything we can do for them, just shout. 
                    Take care and I’ll talk to you again in the not too distant future. 
                    It’s been a delight ‘working’ with you xx (I would recommend you to anyone, and I know everything is going to fabulous) 
                    
                    Much love   <i class="bx bxs-quote-alt-right quote-icon-right"></i>  </p>
